## Cache Metrics

All benchmark configurations had prefix caching enabled. The PCP archive contains cache metrics:

Available cache metrics:
- `openmetrics.vllm.vllm.prefix_cache_queries_total` - Total prefix cache lookups
- `openmetrics.vllm.vllm.prefix_cache_hits_total` - Successful prefix cache hits
- `openmetrics.vllm.vllm.connector_prefix_cache_queries_total` - Connector cache lookups
- `openmetrics.vllm.vllm.connector_prefix_cache_hits_total` - Connector cache hits

Observed cache activity:
- Qwen3-0.6B OffloadingConnector: 11,189 connector cache queries
- Qwen3-0.6B LMCache: 5,522 connector cache queries
- Qwen3-8B OffloadingConnector: 3,195 connector cache queries
- Qwen3-8B LMCache: 3,205 connector cache queries

The connector-based configurations show active cache usage, demonstrating that the CPU offload mechanism is actively managing cached key-value pairs.

## GPU Resource Utilization

![GPU Utilization Comparison](gpu_utilization_comparison.png)

![GPU Key Findings](gpu_key_findings.png)

### GPU Utilization Analysis

Analysis of GPU metrics at 1-second resolution reveals an interesting result for the Qwen3-8B model:

#### Qwen3-8B with CPU offload

GPU compute utilization:
- Baseline: 88.3% GPU compute active
- Offload: 80.3% GPU compute active (-9.1% reduction)

GPU memory bandwidth:
- Baseline: 62.8% memory active
- Offload: 69.0% memory active (+9.7%)

GPU memory used:
- Baseline: 15.4 GB
- Offload: 15.7 GB (+2.3%)

Performance impact:
- Throughput: +32.7% (69.9 vs 52.7 tok/s)
- GPU efficiency: +46.2% (0.87 vs 0.60 tok/s per % GPU)

Observation: By offloading KV cache management to CPU, 9.1% of GPU compute resources are freed that were previously occupied with memory operations. This freed capacity is redirected to model inference, resulting in 32.7% higher throughput despite lower overall GPU utilization. The baseline configuration was compute-bound; CPU offload breaks this bottleneck.

The slight increase in memory bandwidth utilization (+9.7%) is more than offset by the reduction in compute utilization, resulting in improved overall efficiency.

#### Qwen3-0.6B with CPU offload

GPU compute utilization:
- Baseline: 75.0% GPU compute active
- Offload: 72.8% GPU compute active (-2.9%)

GPU memory bandwidth:
- Baseline: 38.6% memory active
- Offload: 38.4% memory active (-0.5%)

GPU memory used:
- Baseline: 5.9 GB
- Offload: 6.2 GB (+5.3%)

Performance impact:
- Throughput: -1.9% (minimal difference)

For the smaller model, GPU resources are less constrained, so the benefits of CPU offload are less pronounced. GPU utilization decreases slightly with minimal performance cost.

### GPU Utilization Across Concurrency Levels

Both GPU compute and memory utilization increase with concurrency for all configurations. However:

At low-medium concurrency (5-100):
- Offload maintains 5-10% lower GPU compute usage than baseline
- Performance advantage is consistent

At high concurrency (200+):
- All configurations approach maximum GPU utilization
- Offload still maintains relative efficiency advantage
- System becomes severely overloaded beyond 1000 concurrency

### GPU efficiency improvement

The GPU efficiency improvement (46.2% for Qwen3-8B) stems from better resource allocation:

1. Baseline bottleneck: GPU was spending significant compute cycles on KV cache memory management
2. CPU offload optimization: KV cache operations moved to CPU, freeing GPU compute for inference
3. Result: Same or less GPU usage produces significantly more output

This demonstrates that raw GPU utilization percentage is not the optimization target - what matters is how efficiently those GPU cycles are spent on productive inference work.

## KV Cache Metrics

![Cache Metrics Comparison](cache_metrics_comparison.png)

![Cache Summary](cache_summary.png)

### Cache activity analysis

Analysis of KV cache connector metrics shows the offload configuration generates significantly higher cache activity and better hit ratios compared to baseline.

#### Qwen3-8B cache performance

Cache query rate:
- Baseline: 758 queries/sec average
- Offload: 11,256 queries/sec average (14.8x increase)

Cache hit rate:
- Baseline: 244 hits/sec average
- Offload: 5,135 hits/sec average (21.0x increase)

Cache hit ratio:
- Baseline: 3.6%
- Offload: 46.2% (12.8x improvement)

The offload configuration shows substantially higher cache query activity and achieves a 46.2% hit ratio, meaning nearly half of cache lookups successfully retrieve cached KV data from CPU memory. This reduces redundant GPU computation for cached key-value pairs.

#### Qwen3-0.6B cache performance

Cache query rate:
- Baseline: 749 queries/sec average
- Offload: 18,366 queries/sec average (24.5x increase)

Cache hit rate:
- Baseline: 0 hits/sec average
- Offload: 5,339 hits/sec average

Cache hit ratio:
- Baseline: 0.0%
- Offload: 24.8%

For the smaller model, the baseline configuration shows minimal cache hit activity while the offload configuration achieves a 24.8% hit ratio. The offload configuration's higher cache query rate indicates more active cache management.

### Cache metrics across concurrency levels

Cache activity scales with concurrency for both models. At higher concurrency levels:

- Cache query rates increase proportionally with load
- Hit ratios remain relatively stable across concurrency levels
- Offload configuration maintains its cache hit ratio advantage throughout
- Peak cache query rates exceed 50,000 queries/sec at highest concurrency

### Cache usage percentage

KV cache memory usage remained low throughout testing:
- Qwen3-0.6B: 0.4% average usage for both configurations
- Qwen3-8B: 0.4-0.5% average usage

Low cache memory usage indicates the workload did not generate significant prefix sharing opportunities, yet the offload configuration still achieved notable hit ratios through active cache management.
