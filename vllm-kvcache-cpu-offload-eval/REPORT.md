## GPU Resource Utilization

![GPU Key Findings](gpu_key_findings.png)

### GPU Utilization Analysis

Analysis of GPU metrics at 1-second resolution reveals an interesting result for the Qwen3-8B model:

#### Qwen3-8B: The Efficiency Sweet Spot

**GPU Compute Utilization:**
- **Baseline**: 88.3% GPU compute active
- **Offload**: 80.3% GPU compute active (**-9.1% reduction**)

**GPU Memory Bandwidth:**
- **Baseline**: 62.8% memory active
- **Offload**: 69.0% memory active (+9.7%)

**GPU Memory Used:**
- **Baseline**: 15.4 GB
- **Offload**: 15.7 GB (+2.3%)

**Performance Impact:**
- **Throughput**: +32.7% (69.9 vs 52.7 tok/s)
- **GPU Efficiency**: +46.2% (0.87 vs 0.60 tok/s per % GPU)

**Key Insight**: By offloading KV cache management to CPU, we **free up 9.1% of GPU compute resources** that were previously occupied with memory operations. This freed capacity is redirected to actual model inference, resulting in **32.7% higher throughput** despite lower overall GPU utilization. The baseline configuration was compute-bound; CPU offload breaks this bottleneck.

The slight increase in memory bandwidth utilization (+9.7%) is more than offset by the dramatic reduction in compute utilization, resulting in superior overall efficiency.

#### Qwen3-0.6B: Minimal Impact on Smaller Models

**GPU Compute Utilization:**
- **Baseline**: 75.0% GPU compute active
- **Offload**: 72.8% GPU compute active (-2.9%)

**GPU Memory Bandwidth:**
- **Baseline**: 38.6% memory active
- **Offload**: 38.4% memory active (-0.5%)

**GPU Memory Used:**
- **Baseline**: 5.9 GB
- **Offload**: 6.2 GB (+5.3%)

**Performance Impact:**
- **Throughput**: -1.9% (minimal difference)

For the smaller model, GPU resources are less constrained, so the benefits of CPU offload are less pronounced. However, GPU utilization still decreases slightly with minimal performance cost.

### GPU Utilization Across Concurrency Levels

Both GPU compute and memory utilization increase with concurrency for all configurations. However:

**At Low-Medium Concurrency (5-100):**
- Offload maintains 5-10% lower GPU compute usage than baseline
- Performance advantage is consistent

**At High Concurrency (200+):**
- All configurations approach maximum GPU utilization
- Offload still maintains relative efficiency advantage
- System becomes severely overloaded beyond 1000 concurrency

### The Efficiency Paradox Explained

The **GPU efficiency improvement** (46.2% for Qwen3-8B) stems from better resource allocation:

1. **Baseline bottleneck**: GPU was spending significant compute cycles on KV cache memory management
2. **CPU offload optimization**: KV cache operations moved to CPU, freeing GPU compute for inference
3. **Result**: Same or less GPU usage produces significantly more output

This demonstrates that **raw GPU utilization percentage is not the correct optimization target** - what matters is how efficiently those GPU cycles are spent on productive inference work.
