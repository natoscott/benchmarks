## GPU Resource Utilization

![GPU Utilization Comparison](gpu_utilization_comparison.png)

![GPU Key Findings](gpu_key_findings.png)

### GPU Utilization Analysis

Analysis of GPU metrics at 1-second resolution reveals interesting results for the larger models:

#### Qwen3-14B with CPU offload

GPU compute utilization:
- Baseline: 88.4% GPU compute active
- Offload: 85.0% GPU compute active (-3.8% reduction)

GPU memory bandwidth:
- Baseline: 68.5% memory active
- Offload: 71.9% memory active (+5.0%)

GPU memory used:
- Baseline: 21.9 GB
- Offload: 22.5 GB (+2.7%)

Performance impact:
- Throughput: +23.7% (35.7 vs 28.9 tok/s)
- GPU efficiency: +29.4% (0.42 vs 0.33 tok/s per % GPU)

Observation: The 14B model shows similar patterns to the 8B model, with CPU offload freeing GPU compute resources while improving throughput. The 3.8% reduction in GPU compute usage corresponds to a 23.7% throughput increase, demonstrating efficient resource utilization. The baseline configuration was compute-bound; CPU offload reduces this bottleneck.

#### Qwen3-8B with CPU offload

GPU compute utilization:
- Baseline: 88.3% GPU compute active
- Offload: 80.3% GPU compute active (-9.1% reduction)

GPU memory bandwidth:
- Baseline: 62.8% memory active
- Offload: 69.0% memory active (+9.7%)

GPU memory used:
- Baseline: 15.4 GB
- Offload: 15.7 GB (+2.3%)

Performance impact:
- Throughput: +32.7% (69.9 vs 52.7 tok/s)
- GPU efficiency: +46.2% (0.87 vs 0.60 tok/s per % GPU)

Observation: By offloading KV cache management to CPU, 9.1% of GPU compute resources are freed that were previously occupied with memory operations. This freed capacity is redirected to model inference, resulting in 32.7% higher throughput despite lower overall GPU utilization. The baseline configuration was compute-bound; CPU offload breaks this bottleneck.

The slight increase in memory bandwidth utilization (+9.7%) is more than offset by the reduction in compute utilization, resulting in improved overall efficiency.

#### Qwen3-0.6B with CPU offload

GPU compute utilization:
- Baseline: 75.0% GPU compute active
- Offload: 72.8% GPU compute active (-2.9%)

GPU memory bandwidth:
- Baseline: 38.6% memory active
- Offload: 38.4% memory active (-0.5%)

GPU memory used:
- Baseline: 5.9 GB
- Offload: 6.2 GB (+5.3%)

Performance impact:
- Throughput: -1.9% (minimal difference)

For Qwen3-0.6B, GPU resources are less constrained, so the benefits of CPU offload are less pronounced. GPU utilization decreases slightly with minimal performance cost.

### GPU Utilization Across Concurrency Levels

Both GPU compute and memory utilization increase with concurrency for all configurations. However:

At low-medium concurrency (5-100):
- Offload maintains 3-10% lower GPU compute usage than baseline for larger models
- Performance advantage is consistent across concurrency levels
- Qwen3-14B shows 3-8% reduction, Qwen3-8B shows 5-10% reduction

At high concurrency (200+):
- All configurations approach maximum GPU utilization
- Offload still maintains relative efficiency advantage
- System becomes severely overloaded beyond 1000 concurrency

### GPU efficiency improvement

The GPU efficiency improvements (46.2% for Qwen3-8B, 29.4% for Qwen3-14B) stem from better resource allocation:

1. Baseline bottleneck: GPU was spending significant compute cycles on KV cache memory management
2. CPU offload optimization: KV cache operations moved to CPU, freeing GPU compute for inference
3. Result: Same or less GPU usage produces significantly more output

This demonstrates that raw GPU utilization percentage is not the optimization target - what matters is how efficiently those GPU cycles are spent on productive inference work. Both larger models show this efficiency gain, with the 8B model demonstrating the most pronounced improvement.

## KV Cache Metrics

![Cache Metrics Comparison](cache_metrics_comparison.png)

![Cache Summary](cache_summary.png)

### Cache activity analysis

Analysis of KV cache connector metrics shows the offload configuration generates significantly higher cache activity and better hit ratios compared to baseline.

#### Qwen3-8B cache performance

Cache query rate:
- Baseline: 758 queries/sec average
- Offload: 11,256 queries/sec average (14.8x increase)

Cache hit rate:
- Baseline: 244 hits/sec average
- Offload: 5,135 hits/sec average (21.0x increase)

Cache hit ratio:
- Baseline: 3.6%
- Offload: 46.2% (12.8x improvement)

The offload configuration shows substantially higher cache query activity and achieves a 46.2% hit ratio, meaning nearly half of cache lookups successfully retrieve cached KV data from CPU memory. This reduces redundant GPU computation for cached key-value pairs.

#### Qwen3-0.6B cache performance

Cache query rate:
- Baseline: 749 queries/sec average
- Offload: 18,366 queries/sec average (24.5x increase)

Cache hit rate:
- Baseline: 0 hits/sec average
- Offload: 5,339 hits/sec average

Cache hit ratio:
- Baseline: 0.0%
- Offload: 24.8%

For Qwen3-0.6B, the baseline configuration shows minimal cache hit activity while the offload configuration achieves a 24.8% hit ratio. The offload configuration's higher cache query rate indicates more active cache management.

#### Qwen3-14B cache performance

Cache query rate:
- Baseline: 1,431 queries/sec average
- Offload: 1,588 queries/sec average (1.1x increase)

Cache hit rate:
- Baseline: 41 hits/sec average
- Offload: 43 hits/sec average

Cache hit ratio:
- Baseline: 6.0%
- Offload: 6.0%

The 14B model shows moderate cache activity for both configurations with a 6% hit ratio. Unlike the smaller models where offload dramatically improved cache hit ratios, the 14B model achieves similar hit ratios for both baseline and offload. The query rate is slightly higher for offload (11% increase), but the hit ratio remains consistent. This may be influenced by the different workload characteristics (longer prompts: 750 tokens) and the reduced num_cpu_blocks setting (16000 vs 64000).

### Cache metrics across concurrency levels

Cache activity scales with concurrency for all three models. At higher concurrency levels:

- Cache query rates increase proportionally with load
- Hit ratios remain relatively stable across concurrency levels
- Offload configuration maintains its cache hit ratio advantage for 0.6B and 8B models
- Peak cache query rates exceed 50,000 queries/sec at highest concurrency
- Qwen3-14B shows consistent 6% hit ratio across concurrency levels for both configurations

### Cache usage percentage

KV cache memory usage was substantial across all models:
- Qwen3-0.6B: 37-39% average usage, up to 100% maximum
- Qwen3-8B: 44-53% average usage, up to 100% maximum
- Qwen3-14B: 48-49% average usage, up to 100% maximum

All three models showed significant cache memory utilization, frequently reaching maximum capacity (100%). Despite the high cache memory usage, cache hit ratios varied significantly by model and configuration. The 0.6B and 8B models with offload achieved substantially higher hit ratios (24.8% and 46.2% respectively) compared to baseline, while the 14B model achieved a 6% hit ratio for both configurations. The reduced num_cpu_blocks setting for 14B (16000 vs 64000) may have limited cache reuse opportunities.

## Conclusion

This evaluation shows that vLLM's OffloadingConnector provides performance improvements for the larger models tested (Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B), with throughput increases of 32.7% and 23.7% respectively, alongside reduced latency and lower GPU compute utilization. For Qwen3-0.6B, configurations performed similarly with minimal differences.

The concurrency-based testing methodology shows that these performance characteristics are sustained across various load levels. CPU offload reduces GPU compute usage while simultaneously improving throughput for the larger models tested, resulting in better overall GPU efficiency. The 8B model shows the most pronounced benefits (+32.7% throughput, -9.1% GPU usage), while the 14B model shows moderate improvements (+23.7% throughput, -3.8% GPU usage). These differences may be influenced by the test configuration - all models were tested on the same hardware with different GPU memory utilization settings (0.2 for 0.6B, 0.6 for 8B, full allocation for 14B) and different CPU cache block allocations (64000 for 0.6B/8B, 16000 for 14B), which affects the available KV cache capacity in both GPU and CPU memory.
